# UnityBehaviourTreeSystem
This is a simple behavior tree system I build/am building to assist with a school project. It is still somewhat of a work in progress but is usable as is. The BehaviourTree file houses all of the classes and namespace required to construct the trees and the other two files are implementations I have whipped up for AI in a project I am working on. The AI trees take a reverence to a class that houses the the actual behaviors and then passes refernces to the functions in it to the tree's nodes. 

This is still a work in progress and I am adding to it and polishing it as I go
