# UnityBehaviourTreeSystem
This is a simple behavior tree system I built to assist with a school project. This was written with the intent of being used in conjuntion with Unity3D, and is still somewhat of a work in progress but is usable as is. The BehaviourTree file houses all of the classes and namespace required to construct the trees and the other files are implementations I have whipped up for the game. The trees that I have as examples take a reference to a container class that houses the functions that make up the behaviors. The tree constructor then asigns the functions to the nodes of the tree.

I have temorarily suspended work on this, as I am working on a couple of other projects at the moment. But I intend on revsiting this and finishing it up.

The goal is to change the BehaviourTree class to a factory pattern to make implementation a bit quicker.
